# Intensive Math & Physics Study Schedule

## Monday – Friday

**05:00–07:30 (2.5h) → Math (new learning + exercises)**  
- **Mon/Wed/Fri → Precalculus → Calculus I (as you progress)**  
  - Functions, graphs, limits, derivatives, integrals  
- **Tue/Thu → Linear Algebra basics (once Calc I is steady)**  
  - Vectors, matrices, solving systems, eigenvalues  

**15:00–16:30 (1.5h) → Physics (intro & problem sets)**  
- **Mon/Wed/Fri → Mechanics** (motion, forces, energy, momentum)  
- **Tue/Thu → Waves & E&M basics** (oscillations, circuits, fields)  

**20:30–22:00 (1.5h) → Light review / summary**  
- **Mon:** Review math notes, redo 2–3 problems  
- **Tue:** Review physics notes, conceptual Q&A  
- **Wed:** Mixed review (math + physics quick drills)  
- **Thu:** Focus on weak points (pick hardest concept of week)  
- **Fri:** Weekly recap & planning  

**Weekday total = ~5.5h × 5 = 27.5h**
